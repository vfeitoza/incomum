=========

Don't put on production before read this!

There is a possibility for your Squid to be imcompatible with this script.
When you initialize Squid, a process-father has the basic function to initialize process-children.
These shall receive and treat the requests. 

In some versions, each child process initialize some instancy from sctipt called in storeurl_rewrite_program.
These children processes stay active until the parent process decides to remove them from memory.
In some versions of Squid, when children process are removed from memory, they do not remove the external program, letting it “orphan”.
In younger versions, that does not happen.

You have to check if your version of Squid produces this unexpected result before putting it in production.
This can be done verifying how many processes run inComum:

$ ps ax|grep inComum 

It is normal that the number is a little bit bigger or smaller than the number shown in storeurl_rewrite_children. It is a problem if this number keeps growing (it will take all your memory with ghosts processes).

Observe the system at the first day and check out its behavior.

If there are not large changes in quantity, your system is ready to have the script implanted.
