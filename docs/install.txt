PRE-REQUISITES
--------------
=> Squid2 >= v2.7 (yet not ported for Squid3)
For better results, Squid must be compiled with --enable-http-violations directive.

Some versions may present problems. Read important.txt before install.

NetFlix videos plugin needs ignore-no-store patch present in Lusca Cache

INSTALL
----------
1. Compile the helper

# make all

If using boost library, use this: 
# make all ENABLE_BOOST=y

To compile in debug mode (to show URL rewrites on /tmp/inComum-*.log)
# make all DEBUG=y

2. Put file inComum in /usr/lib/squid and inComum.conf in /etc/squid/

# cp ./inComum /usr/lib/squid/
# cp ./inComum.conf /etc/squid/

3. Make it runnable

# chmod +x /usr/lib/squid/inComum

4. Change owner to the same squid runner (usually proxy.proxy):

# chown proxy.proxy /usr/lib/squid/inComum
# chown proxy.proxy /etc/squid/inComum.conf

5. Configure inComum.conf

For now, you may change the following options:
-storeurl_rewrite_children
-maximum_object_size

6. Install helper on squid.conf

To install add following line on squid.conf:

include /etc/squid/inComum.conf

IMPORTANT: above line MUST be inserted BEFORE any other config.
(Not exactly: must be before acl QUERY or any other refresh_pattern).
