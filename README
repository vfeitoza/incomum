inComum 0.4.0
=======
Squid (or Lusca) helper to be used with storeurl_rewrite_program feature.
His goal is to create equivalency rules for distinct but equivalent URLs.
This allows you to cache resources from domains witch do load balance.
Eg: youtube, avast, etc.

Some sites (like youtube) add HTTP headers to avoid cache (or, at least, to reduce it).
Because of that, this program works better when Squid is compiled with
--enable-http-violations directive.

You may check typing "% squid -v" on your shell prompt. In the case your
installed pack has not this directive (and you are using debian), you
may follow the tutorial wich comes with this documentation.
